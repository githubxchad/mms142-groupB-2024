      <h1 class="pages-title">Chapter 1:<br>What is Disruptive Technology?</h1>
      <p>More often than not, what we consider to be “disruptive” technology boils down to new products in the market that “interrupts” or alters the way we go about certain tasks. If this description were held to be true, then any new tech that is invented, enters the market, and becomes popular or successful is therefore considered disruptive technology.</p>

      <p>However, there's more to it than that. Clayton Christensen, the man who coined the term “disruptive innovation” in the mid 1990s, defined it as “the process in which a smaller company, usually with fewer resources, is able to challenge an established business (often called an incumbent).” This quote is further clarified in an article by Ilan Mochari, who explains that actual “disruption” is when incumbents are so focused on appealing to their most profitable customers, they fail to address the needs of those downmarket — leading to other businesses, or entrants, to step in and target this ignored segment with a more affordable option compared to that of the incumbent’s. Eventually, entrants gain popularity and offer solutions to the incumbent’s mainstream customers — practically kicking them out of the game entirely.</p>

      <p>An example of a truly disruptive technology is the personal computer. It succeeded the typewriter, the latter now merely an antique collectible rather than a tool of everyday use. Despite the typewriter’s popularity and usefulness back in the day, it failed to address a major problem — users couldn’t make a single mistake. People had to type meticulously with a vigilant eye, backspacing was not an option and many didn’t have the privilege to redo the entire page just for one mistake. The personal computer addressed and met this need, thus the typewriter’s time had finally come.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of a “Disruptive” Technology</h2>
    <p>While it may come as a challenge still to discern whether a product is disruptive or not based on its definition alone, there are some characteristics unique to disruptive tech that will help set it apart.</p>

    <ol type="a">
      <b><li>Affordable and Accessible</li></b>
      <p>Though disruptive technology does not always start with the same success and popularity as the product it is challenging, often beginning with higher costs and lower performance capabilities, they improve faster than the original product is able to keep up with — becoming cost-effective and accessible to the masses.</p>
      <b><li>Innovation Route</li></b>
      <p>To discern whether a product is disruptive, observe the course of its innovation. Disruptive technologies have this trajectory of improvement, as mentioned above, that allows them to keep in stride with and eventually transcend other existing products regarding performance and capabilities — rendering them moot more often than not.</p>
      <b><li>New Market Entrants</li></b>
      <p>The minds behind disruptive technology are essentially new players in the field of the game. As incumbents are so busy appealing to their most profitable customers, they tend to overlook other companies or start-ups seeking to compete with them, which is an opportunity that attracts new investors hoping to rattle the industry.</p>
      <b><li>Market Modification</li></b>
      <p>And, at its core, disruptive technology is capable of completely changing the industry for which it was intended; reconstructing consumer behavior, supply chains, and business models.</p>
