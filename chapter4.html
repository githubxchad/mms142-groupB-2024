      <h1 class="pages-title">Chapter 4: <br>Why are wearable devices disruptive?</h1><br>
      <h3>New versus Old</h3>
      <p>The emergence of wearable devices has revolutionized medical care in the health industry. Devices for health monitoring have replaced traditional methods of health monitoring, offering more descriptive and actionable data. Instead of relying on information from physical checkups (Luong, 2024) and interviews with patients (KMS, 2024), wearables can monitor heart rates, sleep patterns, and other recorded activities in real-time (Luong, 2024). This allows both patients and doctors to track data, identify trends, and proactively prescribe health improvements (Luong, 2024).</p>
      <p>Wearable devices also allow for continuous health monitoring, offering insights into past behaviors (KMS, 2024). For example, fitness trackers monitor heart rates, calories burned, and other fitness metrics to guide personal health improvement (Luong, 2024). In summary, wearable devices are gaining popularity due to their prescriptive use of logged data, making them a more efficient alternative to traditional health monitoring (Casselman et al., 2017).</p>

      <h2>Unique Features That Disrupt The Health Industry</h2>
      <h3>Wearable sensor (Casselman et al., 2017)</h3>
      <p>One of the key features that sparked the popularity of wearable devices is wearable sensors. These sensors collect physiological data such as heart rates and blood pressure (Luong, 2024), as well as activity data such as sleep scores and step counts (Banaee et al., 2013). Data is recorded in real time, allowing users to gain insights into their health and set future goals based on analytics (Luong, 2024). Wearable sensors are especially popular among individuals tracking their fitness and improving their physical health.</p>
      <p>In addition, wearable sensors can save lives. The SimpleWave, for example, was developed by Angelo Umali after his grandmother died unexpectedly due to a fall. This device detects falls, analyzes the cause, and alerts caretakers (Buban, 2015).</p>

      <h3>Data entry, exit, storage, and transfer (Erkılıç, C. E., & Yalçın, A., 2020)</h3>
      <p>Another revolutionary feature of wearable devices is their ability to record, store, and transfer data (Erkılıç & Yalçın, 2020). In the Information Age, data analytics can shape lives and industries, including healthcare. After data is gathered via sensors (Luong, 2024), it is logged, analyzed, and stored for easy access. This data can be shared with healthcare professionals via Bluetooth for real-time monitoring, which is especially valuable in areas such as cardiovascular health (Buban, 2015).</p>

      <h2>Examples of impacts and products on the market</h2>
      <h3>Apple Watch</h3>
      <p>The Apple Watch is a smart wearable device that tracks heart rate, steps, calories burned, and sleep patterns. It also integrates with other iPhone features, such as music and notifications (Veenstra, 2018). Apple quickly became the third-largest wearable vendor after launching the Apple Watch in 2016, and the product's focus shifted to health and fitness over time due to increasing demand (Veenstra, 2018).</p>

    <div class="report-section">
      <h3>FitBit</h3>
      <p>Released in 2014, FitBit became a major player in the wearable market, especially for health and fitness. The company sold around 10 million wearables that year and continued to expand rapidly. FitBit tracks a range of data, including steps, distance traveled, and heart rates, and offers users a way to track and personalize their health data (Veenstra, 2018). FitBit’s use of data-driven features has helped users achieve greater control over their health and fitness goals (FitBit, 2018).</p>
