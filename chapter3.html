      <h2>Traditional Healthcare Practices</h2>
      <p>Throughout history, traditional healthcare practices were conducted in general wards, which were non-specialist units at the time, offering various treatment processes to patients. As medical technology advances and complex health issues have risen, more and more critically ill patients are being treated in general wards. As such, these patients require frequent attention and the need to identify patterns and observe changes in their records, most especially their vital signs. Various measurements are obtained and monitoring routines executed as part of assessing patients' health statuses. These monitoring routines include documenting respiratory rates, oxygen levels, body temperature, heartbeat, blood pressure readings, and level of consciousness. (NICE, 2007) Nowadays, the evolving practice requires the expertise of healthcare professionals who frequently observe patients' vital signs. Frequent visitations require a systematic schedule that depends on patients’ level of severity and the healthcare provider’s judgment of the situation. Getting vital signs requires a long time and is usually recorded on charts by healthcare personnel.  (Sahandi et al., 2009)

      <h2>Challenges and Limitations in Traditional Healthcare Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Data Quality<br>
        <br>Maintaining good quality data is a critical concern in healthcare monitoring practices. The accuracy and integrity of the data can affect the effectiveness of healthcare provisions. Medical professionals must ensure that the data collected during monitoring routines is accurate and complete since inaccurate data may lead to wrong conclusions and diagnoses. Sahandi et al. (2009) noted that most of the monitoring and tracking systems are paper-based in our current healthcare services. Most medical diagnoses are still documented on paper, which is susceptible to illegibility. Healthcare providers may lack ready access to the data of their critically ill patients. Moreover, the recording of vital signs and completion of patient charts often remains incompetent. Poor data entry results in poor-quality monitoring systems. Many existing triage and tracking systems miss a significant number of information for patients who need help.</li><br>
        <div><img src="media/c3b.png" class="image-container"></div>
        <li>Limitations on Resources<br>
        <br>Limitations on resources affect healthcare providers to monitor and provide effective healthcare provision. Constraints on healthcare personnel may affect the accuracy and quality of healthcare evaluations and procedures. Sahandi et al. (2009) observe that an increase in medical errors and issues in patient monitoring is caused by an increased number of patients per healthcare professional. And therefore an unfair ratio is observed. </li><br>
        <div><img src="media/c3c.png" class="image-container"></div>
        <li>Lack of Standardization<br>
        <br>The absence of standard conventions in monitoring practices is another crucial factor in the effectiveness of traditional healthcare practices. A lack of standardization in procedures may confuse and draw inaccurate conclusions. Various healthcare providers utilize diverse and inconsistent metrics to assess healthcare quality, preventing efficient comparison and evaluation across different healthcare facilities. Moreover, there exists a lack of standardization in communicating and documenting medical information. Abdelmageed (2014) cited that there is a gap in the standard model for communicating and documenting records across National Health Services (NHS) in England (Scott, 2004).</li><br>
        <div><img src="media/c3d.png" class="image-container"></div>
        <li>Timeliness<br>
        <br>The delay between healthcare procedures may affect the accuracy and completeness of healthcare provisions. Healthcare providers may face a lot of variability between the time of care and the time of monitoring. Moreover, there are also issues with timely access to medical information. Medical notes are more often than not, poorly maintained, and patient records may not be readily available since they are sometimes treated as low priority. There are also cases in which medical records have inappropriate remarks, illegible information, lack of details, and inconsistencies (Abdelmageed, 2014).</li><br>
        <div><img src="media/c3e.jpg" class="image-container"></div>
        <li>Costs<br>
        <br>Healthcare cost is one of the significant challenges that need careful consideration and resolution within the industry. Traditional monitoring procedures heavily rely on manual and paper-based monitoring records and the utilization of manual monitoring records leads to various costly procedures, such as duplicating documents, allocating numerous personnel to manage physical charts, and designation of space for storage while protecting the records against damage (Arti, 2018).  Furthermore, the loss or absence of paper-based test results may need repetitive and redundant testing, leading to escalating healthcare expenses (Witt, 2023).</li><br>
