        Disruptive Impact of Wearable Devices on the Health Industry</h1>

      <h1>Market and industry shifts due to wearable devices</h1>
      <p>Wearable devices such as fitness trackers and smartwatches have revolutionized healthcare in various ways. These are not just changes in what specific devices do, but instead how these devices have made significant impact towards how patients and healthcare practitioners perceive healthcare.<br>
        <br>
        You may have heard of Apple smartwatches, but there are also a variety of companies that increased the market and gave rise to wearable devices in healthcare. companies such as FitBit and Garmin also now offer products that track fitness and health, which eventually expanded the consumer market beyond traditional healthcare products. A great example of this would be how doctors now use data from wearables to track patients’s health, especially for those with other conditions like diabetes, heart diseases, fertility, arrhythmias, and others (Jafleh et al, 2024). This positive shift from going to see doctors with limited clinic hours to having access to on-hand data has made healthcare more real-time and preventive rather than reactive.

      <h1>Unique features that disrupt the health industry (Trends)</h1>
      <p>Wearable devices have become much more popular, and this trend is ready to continue. Smartwatches aren’t just for telling the time or counting steps, they now also offer valuable data such as heart rate, sleep patterns, blood pressure, and even blood sugar levels. This massive advancement 	is making healthcare more personalized and accessible for the user, which allows them to monitor their health regularly without needing to visit their local doctor all the time. <br>
        <br>
        According to the analytical site “MarketsAndMarkets”, the global market for these devices is expected to significantly increase and grow, reaching around $130 billion around 2029. The reason behind this growth is the increasing awareness of health and fitness, as well as the convenience of having crucial health data at your fingertips. These devices can help people track their fitness goals and provide important insights on how their body is doing, making it easier to deal with health issues before they become serious. <br>
        <br>
        These devices are helping healthcare professionals to improve patients’ treatments by giving them live data. For instance, if a person with diabetes would wear a glucose monitor, the doctor can get alerts if their blood sugar levels go way too high or too low, making it easier to take action right away. Instead of being a reactive system (where people only visit the hospital when something is already wrong), it becomes a proactive system (where patients can manage their health in real-time. <br>
        <br>
        While North America (NA) leads in the adoption of wearable health tech, this growing trend is not just limited to one region, countries in Asia are quickly catching up due to rising health awareness and increasing investments in technology. Wearable devices are also seen as  cost-effective solutions for healthcare systems, as they reduce transportation costs and hospital confinements. This is especially important in today’s world where healthcare costs are rising, and people are trying ways to manage their health more efficiently and affordably.

      <h1>Examples of impact on the market</h1>
      <p>Companies that offer wearable technology in the healthcare aspect have brought healthcare to people’s fingertips (quite literally). These devices are not constrained to fitness trackers anymore, but they’ve also been essential in monitoring health daily.
        <br>
        A prime example is the <b>Apple Watch</b>, which has integrated health monitoring features such as heat rate tracking, ECG (electro diagram), and fall detection. Around 2018, Apple received FDA approval for the apple watch’s ECG feature, which allows users to detect potential signs of heart conditions such as Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) (MobiHealthNews, 2020). This feature allowed users to take immediate action if irregularities were detected, potentially saving lives.

        <br>
        Similarly, <b>FitBit</b> has also had a profound impact on offering health tracking tools such as step counting, sleep monitors, heart rate measurements, and many more. It also has a premium service which provides health guidance catered towards the users current state, encouraging 	users to make lifestyle changes for better health management. 
        <div><img src="media/c5d.png" class="image-container"></div>
        <br>
        Although <b>Garmin</b> is usually known for its GPS technology, they have also made a significant impact on the wearable healthcare market with its advanced health and fitness trackers. Unlike the Apple smartwatch or FitBit, Garmin primarily focuses on active lifestyles, like athletes, adventurers, fitness enthusiasts, and many others. Garmin also integrates “body battery energy monitoring”, a feature that calculates the body’s energy levels by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV), stress, and sleep data. This innovative technology helps users understand their physical needs and readiness for activity or rest, making it highly beneficial for both active and inactive individuals who would like to manage their stress or fatigue.

        <br>
        These are only a few of these technologies that were mentioned, but nonetheless they have made health management more accessible and affordable. The lone fact that they have been able to monitor health conditions real-time is already revolutionizing the healthcare industry. This not only provides doctors with more data to make more informed decisions, it also empowers patients to take control of their health.
