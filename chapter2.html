	<h2>Overview of Wearable Devices</h2>
      <p>Wearable Devices as healthcare technology are devices that track and monitor certain activities and parameters that are considered relevant to a user’s health data. They utilize different sensing mechanisms to detect and measure said parameters which ultimately helps analyze it and potentially provide predictions and recommendations outside clinical environments. These sensors typically use one or more of the following modalities (Karve, 2024): </p>

  <li>Temperature which makes use of thermistors to measure distinct changes in body temperature</li>
  <li>Electrochemistry used to detect biochemical substances</li>
  <li> Ultrasound, which is what is typically utilized for measuring blood pressure, senses signals from deeper tissues</li>
  <li>Magnetic field that focuses on changes in mechanical energy and allows for the monitoring of motion </li>
        <li>Optoelectronics for specific optical properties of biological molecules</li>
        <li>Pressure to detect mechanical deformations and quantify physiological signals</li>
    </ul>
<p> With these biosensors, wearable devices have been utilized to monitor specific substances as well as biological molecules such as glucose and cholesterol levels, blood oxygen levels and heart rate, and even blood pressure (Canali et al., 2022). Detecting and monitoring these parameters have been utilized to record the user’s general health condition and to detect any significant anomalies that could be indicators of bigger health complications. Utilizing this technology has been vital to making information easily obtainable to healthcare teams, and even more to the monitoring and recording of data from patients with specific conditions. Besides monitoring purposes, these devices also serve other functions within the health context (Canali et al., 2022). Through screening, wearable devices are also able to identify specific conditions and individuals with certain conditions by comparing its measurements to pre-existing datasets. As mentioned previously, it is also used to detect conditions using the data it has monitored, and potentially alert users based on its analysis of patterns, indicators and markers. Following its detection of said patterns, wearable devices also serve as potential predictors of future trends. </p>
     <p> Placed within the current context of healthcare technology, wearable devices have mostly been used in effective clinical care, biomedical research, for personal health practices and tracking purposes (Canali et al., 2022). It has allowed users to take a more proactive role in how they manage their health, most especially for those that are diagnosed with specific ailments. These wearable devices make health monitoring more accessible, integrating it into people’s routines and daily life. Some of the most common examples of these devices include smartwatches and fitness trackers, blood pressure monitors, glucose meters, and ECG monitors (Karve, 2024).</p>
