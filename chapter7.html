            <h1>The Impact of Wearable Devices on Health Monitoring</h1>
            <p>The healthcare industry was revolutionized by wearable devices, their advanced sensor technology and data analysis reshaped the way we monitor our health and care for it. They’re simple and efficient, allowing for constant health surveillance, catching early signs of an illness, and overall improved access to healthcare services. This transition from traditional methods to wearable devices lets both health professionals and the masses focus on staying on top of things instead of fixing problems after they happen or have become too difficult to cure.</p>

            <h1>Proactive Health Management and Personalization</h1>
            <p>By making health monitoring and tracking accessible to the general public, wearable devices have allowed for users to play a much more proactive role in the regulation of their own health, and for the administration of patient care to be more preventive instead of reactive. It is transforming healthcare into something more personalized and specific to each individual, as it efficiently manages and records patient history. And, consequently, it has proven to be beneficial to patients with certain conditions that require particular attention and care <span class="citation">(Jafieh et al., 2024)</span>.</p>

            <h1>Future Advancements and their Potential Impact</h1>
            <p>While there is still much to be improved with regards to its accuracy and reliability, especially in terms of predictions, further advancements could alleviate some of the burdens that currently weigh down healthcare systems around the world. More particularly, it could decrease, or potentially negate, the need for invasive health monitoring altogether, and also minimize emergency interventions and hospitalizations <span class="citation">(Shajari et al., 2024)</span>. With greater accuracy and accessibility, these wearable devices could have an irreversible impact on how the healthcare industry functions, as well as its relations to patient care and health administration.</p>
